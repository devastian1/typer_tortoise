// This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into including all the files listed below.
// Add new JavaScript/Coffee code in separate files in this directory and they'll automatically
// be included in the compiled file accessible from http://example.com/assets/application.js
// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// the compiled file.
//
// All the JS assets are compiled by the ember-cli app in /frontend,
// which gets added to the page by the ember-cli-rails gem. Nothing to see here.
